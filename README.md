## CRUD React app

This application is a full stack web app that allows you to search for books using the google books api and save them to a mongoDB database.

The front-end is built on React, using presentational and container components along with React Router for handling route end points.

## Deployment (Heroku)

Deployed on heroku using a continuous integration through this github repo, feel free to make  a PR and take your own spin with this application.
